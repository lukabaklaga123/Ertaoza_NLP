# Ertaoza_NLP (Abstract)
  
 An NLP library containing entity extraction, sentiment analysis, automatic language identification, and other features for creating bots
 
 "The Ertaoza team has put in place a Georgian language model that can produce text based on the circumstances"
 
 A general natural language tool for Python is called Etaoza NLP. Presently assisting:

.Determine a phrase's language

.Two strings' fast Levenshtein distance

.Get the string's best substring that is closer to a given pattern with less Levenshtein distance.


.Emotion evaluation of words (with negation support).

.Known Entity The introduced text does not have to be perfect because of recognition, management, support for several languages, and acceptance of similar strings.

.a classifier using natural language processing to categorize the intents of utterances.


# Permision/Goal

As a result, you may use our model to generate Georgian text, and if you have a lot of computer power, you can improve your results by training the model on more Georgian text.

QDGAT == > 

They largely follow the NumNet architecture with significant extension of how Graph representations are handled, which also leads to significant improvement in performance. Graphs now take into account the types of numbers included in each sentence and the entity they relate to. Edge creation still represents the fact that two nodes coexist in a sentence. As before a Graph neutral network (GNN) is trained on those and different output layers are used for the different types of answers :
